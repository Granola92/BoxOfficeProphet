We used linear regression as we were attempting to predict a continuous numerical value. The model started with a simple multiple linear regression, where
we inputted as many features as we thought may work. We found that revenue could be predicted with an R squared of 68%, while other outcome variables did
not show a very statistically significant relationship. We then tried to determine which of our 250 input variables were actually impacting the model. Since our input
data was scaled, we were able to compare the linear coefficients on each feature to determine their importance. We switched to a lasso regressor and decreased the
tolerance for model complexity. We decreased the complexity until R squared began to decrease, leaving around 40 features that kept an R squared of 66%.
